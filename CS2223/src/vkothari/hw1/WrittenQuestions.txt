Q1. Stack Experiments (30 Points):
----------------------------------

1.1. ( 2 + 3 + 4 ) is a well formatted and a proper expression, however it does not work as the result turns out to be 7. The ops stack has the The vals stack has the value 2.
1.2. ( 9 - - 2 ) is not a well formatted expression and the result turns out to be 7. The ops stack has a null for the first element. The vals stack has the 2 "-" operators.  
1.3. - 99 is not a valid expression as there can be no operation first  without there being a number before it, hence it does not work and the result is 99.  . The ops stack The vals stack has the "-" operator. 
1.4. 2 * 3 + 7 /4 yields 1.75 which is not right. The ops stack becomes of size 2 and contains the "*" and "+" operators. The vals stack contains the result. 
1.5. This operation is well formatted and yields the correct result which is 4.625.  The ops stack is empty. The vals stack contains 4.625 before being popped and nothing after. 
1.6. check evaluate for added modulus and ceiling 
1.7. The operation yields 2, which is right. The ops stack is empty. The vals stack contains the value 2
