Written Questions

Q1. HeapSort Empirical Evaluation 
Example Data:
N	MaxComp	MaxExch
16	25	11
32	52	22
64	115	48
128	234	94
256	473	186
512	976	391

  This supports the proposal because the number of compares is at most double the number of exchanges
because we need two compares to determine whether to exchange an item with its
greater child. And there are N-1 Exchanges for N items in a any heap when sunk. 
Therefore if Exch is about N Comparisions must be about 2N in the worst case. 

Q2. Recurrence Relationship
---------------------------

Determine C(N) for BinaryArraySearch and determine the upper bound (worst case)
and the lower bound (best case).

a. C(N) = C(N/2) + 1
b. C(1) =  1
C(N)=C(1) +log(N)
C(N)= 1+ log(N)
c.  Best Case: 1
d. Worst Case: log(N) + 1 same as C(N)

Q3. Sorted Linked Lists (25 pts)
--------------------------------

Complete implementation

Report on the timing difference between your run and the example from Day 12.

The timing difference between my run and the example from Day 12 showed that my run was 0.02  seconds faster as it gave 0.56 compared to 0.58(from day 12) which hence proves that the sequential sort that I have implemented is more  efficient.
   
Q4. Binary Search Tree (45 pts)
-------------------------------
